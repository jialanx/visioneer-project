Title:  Bird Companion with CV

Project Description: Interact with a cartoon bird in realtime with Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. Play with your companion by moving your hands around!

Challenges I have faced: This is my first time ever using Computer Vision. I basically followed a tutorial for the entire first hour to have it set up. I was also extremely confused with the Alpha blending. For both of these challenges I did my best to understand why each line of code was needed and what they did! You can see I commented a lot on the project- I really wanted to understand what was going on since I was googling a LOT of things.

Overall, I had a bunch of fun making this project. I was up all night figuring things out. When I woke up I would continue testing it and debugging. Some of it was hard. A lot of it was funny! Especially once the bird sprites came in and it visually started spasming out. I can't wait to make more projects like this in the future.

Not too sure what else to add here, I am still getting into the hacking community and have little experience with files and whatnot!

Thank you so much for your time
